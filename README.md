# Java Logical Operators

This Java program (`Logic.java`) showcases the usage of logical operators, including AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`). It demonstrates how these operators are used to evaluate logical expressions and determine boolean results.

## Description

The program evaluates several logical expressions involving integer variables `i`, `b`, and `c`. It demonstrates the logical AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`) operators in different scenarios, including complex expressions.

## Usage

To run the program:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `Logic.java` file.
4. Compile the Java file using the following command:
5. 5. Run the compiled Java program using the command:
6. The program will display the boolean results of the evaluated logical expressions.
